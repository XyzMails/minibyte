minibyte made by niko

if ur gonna add an command or make a version of minibyte with a "brand new sexy" command 
try to contact me on discord or sum if you want to see your command in the minibyte,
of course you will be credited i no skied!!!

ways to make commands:
to make a brand new sexy command you will have to change a FEW.. things..
you will have to make a coye of thhe minibyte tui / or the cmd version and do the new command there
so first think of a command u wanna add. i for example i will make a command that says penis simple and funny.
ok so first you gotta modify the code, heres mine

def penis_func(args=None):
    return "P\n" \
    return "E\n" \
    return "N\n" \
    return "I\n" \
    return "S"

put the modified code in somewhere where the commands are *NOT IN A COMMAND* just wheres free space on the middle.
you gotta also modify the function code... heres what u need to add

all functions
functions = {
#stock commands / functions here
    "penis": penis_func,
}

ok, now either u make a repository creditin me and stuff or dm me if u want to add that command!!!
DISCORD:
python.is.slow

yes.. thats my username on discord thats how u modify the code! simple u can change the tui too, which i kinda wouldnt suggest
