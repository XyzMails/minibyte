i wanted to make an programming language similar to
luaU and python...

make sure to launch "installREQUIREMENTS.bat" or "installREQUIREMENTS" if u dont have the file extensions enabled.
BTW!!!!!!! the cmd version is outdated, use tui for more updated / better experience
"help" for commands lolz

# extras
u got some uh code1.byte very gud softwaerr so basically to explain this its just u can make ur own code in minibyte, more comfortably. so yeah do some kewl stuffz!!! USE PYTHON FOR .byte
